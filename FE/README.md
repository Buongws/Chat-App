## Introduction

This project is our assignment to build a React application. Our goal in this project is to apply the knowledge we have learned in the FPT Fresher program to build a real-world application. We are going to build a simple Discord clone.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:3que/front-end.git
cd discord-clone-fe
npm install
```

## Usage

First, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`

````env

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
````

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.
